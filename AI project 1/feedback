Performance 75.02
-----------------

You performance is ok, but does poorly on more difficult examples.  This
is evidence that you need to use a stronger heuristic.

Code
----

You are correctly implementing A* but are not correctly implementing
the heuristic.  You don't need the casts to int or the condition
if x < ...  In either case you need to be adding the two absolute values.
This cause your heuristic to be too small and perform poorly.  Also, 
there are ways to implement it without the calls to index that is much 
faster.  See the email I will send out to the class about the Manhattan
metric.


Description
-----------

Please put this in the git repo and call it description.txt.  You should
make sure to discuss the steps you take to test and improve your code.
