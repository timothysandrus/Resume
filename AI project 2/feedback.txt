You solver does not always find the correct solution.  This is due
to errors in your isConsistent function.

isConsistent
------------

In both check the contents of the cell and examining the neighbors you have
an error.  You need to make sure that the other location that you are checking
is not the same as location.  This is why on some of the puzzles, you
are returning an incorrect soluition.  Until you get this fixed, you 
should comment out your code in infer.  You will know your code is good when
it is submitted for testing and every example either passes of runs out
of time.

infer
-----

You cannot append to a list that you are looping through.  Change
the for loop to a while loop.  After that this should work.

After you fix the bugs and it works correctly on all of the cases.  You
should consider implementing the MRV heuristic for move ordering.  And
then consider adding some more sophistacated logic to infer.
